    To start, let’s break down the two words separately. Graphic design is the effective visual communication of an <br>  idea or concept and theory is a system of <br>ideas intended to explain something. So, put simply, design theory is a system of ideas that explains how and why design works. Designers need to know how everything they put on a page communicates, influences, directs, invites, entices and excites an audience—design theory explains why.

        Design theory can be broken into several theoretical approaches for understanding, explaining and describing design <br>
        knowledge and practice and, next, we’re going to break <br>these down for you. Shillington London teacher Andy Lester explained to us what, as <br>
         a designer, design theory means to him:
        
        Design theory is the asking and answering of the question “Why am I designing it this way?” If you can’t answer that <br>
         question at every stage of the design process, you <br>probably need to do a bit more thinking.</p>
